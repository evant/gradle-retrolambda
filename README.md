Gradle Retrolambda Plugin
========================

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/me.tatarka/gradle-retrolambda/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/me.tatarka/gradle-retrolambda)

This plugin will automatically build your java or *android* project with
retrolambda, giving you lambda goodness on java 6 or 7. It relies on the
wonderful [retrolambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda) by Esko
Luontola.

Note: The minimum android gradle plugin is `1.0.0`.

Usage
----

1. Download [jdk8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

2. Add the following to your build.gradle

   ```groovy
   buildscript {
      repositories {
         mavenCentral()
      }

      dependencies {
         classpath 'me.tatarka:gradle-retrolambda:3.2.5'
      }
   }

   // Required because retrolambda is on maven central
   repositories {
      mavenCentral()
   }

   apply plugin: 'com.android.application' //or apply plugin: 'java'
   apply plugin: 'me.tatarka.retrolambda'
   ```
   **Note**: If you are using the `2.0.0-alpha/beta` android gradle plugins, you should use `3.3.0-beta4` since it better supports instant run.
   
   alternatively, you can use the new plugin syntax for gradle `2.1+`
   ```groovy
   plugins {
      id "me.tatarka.retrolambda" version "3.2.5"
   }
   ```

3. There is no step three!

The plugin will compile the source code with java8 and then replace the class
files with the output of retrolambda.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is entirely optional, the plugin will by default pick up the
`JAVA5_HOME`/`JAVA6_HOME`/`JAVA7_HOME`/`JAVA8_HOME` environment variables. It's also smart
enough to figure out what version of java you are running gradle with. For
example, if you have java8 set as your default, you only need to define
`JAVA5_HOME`/`JAVA6_HOME`/`JAVA7_HOME`. If you need to though, you can add a block like the
following to configure the plugin:

```groovy
retrolambda {
  jdk System.getenv("JAVA8_HOME")
  oldJdk System.getenv("JAVA6_HOME")
  javaVersion JavaVersion.VERSION_1_6
  jvmArgs '-arg1', '-arg2'
  defaultMethods false
  incremental true
}
```

- `jdk` Set the path to the java 8 jdk. The default is found using the
    environment variable `JAVA8_HOME`. If you a running gradle with java 5, 6 or 7,
    you must have either `JAVA8_HOME` or this property set.
- `oldJdk` Sets the path to the java 5, 6 or 7 jdk. The default is found using the
    environment variable `JAVA5_HOME`/`JAVA6_HOME`/`JAVA7_HOME`. If you are running gradle
    with java 8 and wish to run unit tests, you must have either
    `JAVA5_HOME`/`JAVA6_HOME`/`JAVA7_HOME` or this property set. This is so the tests can be
    run with the correct java version.
- `javaVersion` Set the java version to compile to. The default is 6. Only 5, 6 or
    7 are accepted.
- `include 'Debug', 'Release'` Sets which sets/variants to run through
    retrolambda. The default is all of them.
- `exclude 'Test'` Sets which sets/variants to not run through retrolambda. Only
    one of either `include` or `exclude` should be defined.
- `jvmArgs` Add additional jvm args when running retrolambda.
- `defaultMethods` Turn on default and static methods in interfaces support. Note: due to a
   limitation in retrolamba, this will set `incremental` to false. The default is false.
- `incremental` Setting this to false forces all of your class files to be run through retrolambda
   instead of only the ones that have changed. The default is true.

### Using a Different Version of the retrolambda.jar

The default version of retrolambda used is
`'net.orfjackal.retrolambda:retrolambda:2.3.0'`. If you want to use a different
one, you can configure it in your dependencies.

```groovy
dependencies {
  // Latest one on maven central
  retrolambdaConfig 'net.orfjackal.retrolambda:retrolambda:+'
  // Or a local version
  // retrolambdaConfig files('libs/retrolambda.jar')
}
```

Android Studio Setup
--------------------
Add these lines to your `build.gradle` to inform the IDE of the language level.

```groovy
android {
  compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
}
```

Proguard
----------
This plugin is fully compatible with proguard (since `v2.4.0`). In your proguard file, add
```
-dontwarn java.lang.invoke.*
```

Known Issues
---------------
### Lint fails on java files that have lambdas.
Android's lint doesn't understand java 8 syntax and will fail silently or loudly. There is now an [experimental fork](https://github.com/evant/android-retrolambda-lombok) that fixes the issue.

### Using Google Play Services causes retrolambda to fail
Version `5.0.77` contains bytecode that is incompatible with retrolambda. This should be fixed in
newer versions of play services, if you can update, that should be the preferred solution. To work
around this issue, you can either use an earlier version like `4.4.52` or add `-noverify` to the jvm
args. See [orfjackal/retrolambda#25](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda/issues/25) for more
information.

```groovy
retrolambda {
  jvmArgs '-noverify'
}
```

### Compiling for android-L doesn't work when using Android Studio's sdk manager.
For some reason only known to the gods, when using Android Studio's sdk manager,
there is no `android-L` directory sdk directory. Instead, it happily builds
using the `android-20` directory instead. To work around this, you can symlink
the `android-L` directory to point to `android-20`. See
[#36](https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda/issues/36).

### Build fails with using `android-apt`
This is because `android-apt` modifies the `javaCompile` task and this plugin
replaces it. Since `v2.4.1` this is fixed, you just need to ensure you apply this plugin _last_.
